# The Mathematical Contest in Modeling 2020
I participated in the [MCM competition](https://www.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/) in 2020.

## Problem
Global ocean temperatures affect the quality of habitats for certain ocean-dwellingspecies. When temperature changes are too great for their continued thriving, thesespecies move to seek other habitats better suited to their present and future living andreproductive success. One example of this is seen in the lobster population of Maine,USA that is slowly migrating north to Canada where the lower ocean temperaturesprovide a more suitable habitat. This geographic population shift can signifi cantlydisrupt the livelihood of companies who depend on the stability of ocean-dwellingspecies. 

Your team has been hired as consultants by a Scottish North Atlantic fishery management consortium. The consortium wants to gain a better understanding ofissues related to the potential migration of Scottish herring and mackerel from theircurrent habitats near Scotland if and when global ocean temperatures increase. Thesetwo fi sh species represent a signifi cant economic contribution to the Scottish fi shingindustry. Changes in population locations of herring and mackerel could make iteconomically impractical for smaller Scotland-based fi shing companies, who usefi shing vessels without on-board refrigeration, to harvest and deliver fresh fi sh tomarkets in Scotland fi shing ports.
